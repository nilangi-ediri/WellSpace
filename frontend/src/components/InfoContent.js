                                        Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. Over the course of your life, if you experience mental health problems, your thinking, mood, and behavior could be affected.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including:
                                        <br />
                                        Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry
                                        <br />
                                        Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse
                                        <br />
                                        Family history of mental health problems
                                        <br /><br />
                                        Mental health problems are common but help is available. People with mental health problems can get better and many recover completely.

                                        Mindfulness is the practice of being present and fully engaged with whatever we're doing at the moment â€” free from distraction or judgment, and aware of our thoughts and feelings without getting caught up in them.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        Research has shown that mindfulness can help reduce stress, improve attention, decrease anxiety and depression, and improve overall well-being. Mindfulness practices include:
                                        <br />
                                        Meditation
                                        <br />
                                        Deep breathing exercises
                                        <br />
                                        Body scan exercises
                                        <br />
                                        Mindful eating and walking
                                        <br /><br />
                                        Regular mindfulness practice can lead to a deeper understanding of oneself and a greater sense of peace and calm.
